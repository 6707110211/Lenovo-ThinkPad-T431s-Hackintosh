Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
I said to the Devil, "Devil, do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?"
He said, "Only sundown, Sundays, Christmas"
Some days end when I need a few friends
Now and again, I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been
Don't get me ventin' on friends who resent you
'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless
They fell into Hell where you both hang with nothing to do but
Scratch, kick, let gravity win like
Fuck this, let gravity win like
You could leave it all behind
Even the Devil need time alone sometimes
You could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called "freefall"
It's called "freefall"
Called to the Devil and the Devil said, "Quit
Can't be bothered, better handle y'all shit
Keep about your wits, man, keep about your wits
Know yourself and who you came in with
Can I sit down? I've been hustlin' all day
I can't even count how many souls I've made
Off the same deal you're on
Remember, the Devil ain't a friend to no one
But fine, true
Well, you could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called "freefall"
It's called "freefall"
Called to the Devil and the Devil said, "Hey
Why you been callin' this late?
It's like 2 AM and the bars all close at 10 in Hell
That's a rule I made
Anyway, you say you're too busy
Savin' everybody else to save yourself
And you don't want no help, oh well
That's the story to tell"
Like, you could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called "freefall"
It's called "freefall"
You could let it all go
You could let it all go
'Cause ain't shit free but fallin' out
That shit's easy, let me show you how, it's like
Ain't shit free but fallin' out
That shit's easy, let me show you how, it's like
